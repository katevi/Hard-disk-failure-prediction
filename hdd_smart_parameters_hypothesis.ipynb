Confirming the observations of the feature selection process, ReadError18 was the best attribute, with 27.6% detection at 0.06% false alarms.\n",

The best single attributes from Figure 9 were ReadError1, ReadError3, ReadError18 and ReadError19. Using these four attributes and 15 samples per pattern, the rank-sum test detected 28.1% of the failures, with no measured false alarms.

Fly height variation can cause the media being insufficiently magnetized and the data are not readable. The physically bumping or banging during the HDD reading or writing process leading the head with strong vibration, which can induce the read/write failure. \n",

    "- Spin up time -- S.M.A.R.T. parameter indicates an average time (in milliseconds or seconds) of spindle spinup (from zero RPM (Revolutions Per Minute) to fully operational). The low value means it takes too long for the hard disk to a fully operational state.\n",
